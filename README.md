The African ethnolinguistic Ontology ELO
The ELO was developed to provide a detailed view of the diverse ethnic groups in Africa using an ontology structure. The ELO can be employed to comprehensively classify African study participants in prospective research studies. It can also be used to classify study participants of past studies, by mapping participants using a language or ethnicity identifier or synonyms. Aware of the confusion between the naming of spoken language and the naming of the population groups, we have taken steps in ELO to remove this confusion and focus the information around ethnicities. The ELO will be accessible via a browsable web interface and through the EBI Ontology Lookup Service (ELO).
